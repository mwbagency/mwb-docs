## Functionality

### Relative minimum and maximum dates to date and date time pickers
The [date](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/date-picker/) and [date_and_time ](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/date-time-picker/) ACF field types are given two extra options when editing an ACF field group in WP admin:
- "Minimum relative date" (how far back in time the user can choose)
- "Maximum relative date" (how far forward in time the user can choose)

These use the same arguments as the PHP "[strtotime](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php)" function, allowing for human-readable date / datetime adjustments.
