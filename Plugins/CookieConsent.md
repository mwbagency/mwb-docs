When not using Iubenda for cookie consent, this is a fall-back to that solution.

## Example of use

## Note
As this is instead of Iubenda, the client will have to handle the content for their own legal pages (privacy and cookie policies). We have to stress to the clients that we are not experts here, and that they'll need to keep on top of the policy content legally._

## Setup
Enter the policy url within the MWB plugin's settings (Settings > Cookie Consent)

## Changing cookie policy
Should the cookie policy ever change, these banners must be presented to all users again. To do this, go to the settings page, and enable "Reset consent" and select "Update". This will increment the internal version that users have agreed/disagreed to, and therefore prompt them again for a decision.
