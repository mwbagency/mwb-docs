Primarily for our [Cloud to Print](https://www.cloudtoprint.co.uk/) solution, this adjusts [Vpress' Coreprint plugin](https://www.vpress.com/web-to-print/coreprint/) to play nicely with our system. 

## Functionality
- Moves their single product page editor into a separate modal to keep the page layout manageable
- Moves their pricing matrix from under the product summary, and into the product tabs
- Removes their un-generic adjusting of the checkout "place order" button
